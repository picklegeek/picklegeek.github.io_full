“A village boy with an curious mind” well, that is how I see myself. Being a frequent traveller and having interacted with people from diffrent walks of life, I see how Big data and the Internet in general have influence on even the common folks. Currently working as a freelance web developer and as a data science passionate soul, I intend to become a part of the bigger picture that we all are trying to dicipher with time.
