"A village boy with an curious mind" well,that is how I see myself.Being a frequent traveller and having interacted with people from diffrent walks of life I have seen how Big data and the Internet in general have influenced even the common folks. Currently working as a freelance web developer and as a data science passionate soul, I intend to become a part of the bigger picture.
