Being born in a time when Internet and computer technology was miracles in the eyes of the common folk and at a very rural area I have seen how this "magic" have rapidly changed lives and perceptions of even the poorer sections of society. Growing up admist all the middle class family drama I was exposed to the wonders of Internet and computers from my very childhood that I almost took it for granted.However from Floppy Drives to Cloud storage,from BSNL dialup connections to the high speed mobile networks,from Dangerous Dave to GTA 5,from Nokia 1110 to the latest iPhone X,from Windows 95 to Windows 10,from XBOX 300 to XBOX ONE,from Antenna based B/W Television sets to Netflix on UHD sets.I have seen how the world grew around me without even realising it.
Recently I ran across an amazing ted talk by [Tricia Wang](https://www.triciawang.com/) which summarised to how much we need to invest on socialware.She states how her time and experience in Nokia proved the fact that [Thick data is as important as bigdata.](https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7).
Scrolling through her's and other ethanography based blogs I realise how my personal experiences with technological advancements have proved the same fact.

The game changer technologies haven't always been revolutionising cutting edge technology.When Google introduced the Google Glass most of us considered it revolutionary, but however it failed the game.Even the slightest updates or change in strategy have influenced the tech market widely.For instance the 2005 ubuntu update made it the largest used open source operating system back in the day.
